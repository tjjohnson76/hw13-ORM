# hw 13 - ORM: E-commerce back end

In this assignment, I was tasked with finishing the back end functionality. This application is able to keep create, read, update, and delete all of the three models. The models of Category, Product, and Tag respond to api calls from the postman application. Fort this assingment, I worked on finishing the models and the api routes.
